//we are going to need three different routes for this file
//1. create the schema from the csv file, upload the data into the database with the schema, create API and Database Objects
//2. create the basic CRUD endpoints for an API 
//3. custom endpoints for the API based on user query

//think of a way to break this down
//reuse code from the old project
//make complex functions in the utils folder
